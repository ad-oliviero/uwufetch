make termux_uninstall   # uninstall for termux
```

## Images and copyright info

### How to use images

Notice: images are currently disabled under iOS due to lack of a one command in UwUfetch code

First of all, you will need `viu`, which you can install by following the [guide](https://github.com/atanunq/viu#installation).

`viu` supports [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) and [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)'s image protocols.
If not supported by the current terminal, `viu` uses the fallback Unicode half-block mode (images will look "blocky"), that is the case in many terminal emulators (gnome-terminal, Konsole, etc.). See also: [viu's README](https://github.com/atanunq/viu#description).
